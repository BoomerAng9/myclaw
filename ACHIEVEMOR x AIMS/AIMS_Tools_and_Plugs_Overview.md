# A.I.M.S. Tools & Plug Ecosystem Overview

This file is an overview of the **tool surfaces**, **platform components**, and a **Plug catalog strategy** implied across the Locale + Hybrid Business Architect + A.I.M.S. documents.

## What A.I.M.S. is (operationally)
A.I.M.S. is a **Port + Longshoremen** system: a Next.js “Port” (dashboard + UX) that deploys containerized backends on your Hostinger KVM VPS and exposes them as **Plugs** (repeatable micro-products) and **Tools** (internal services ACHEEVY calls). 

## Core surfaces
- User-facing: Chat w/ ACHEEVY, Plug Marketplace, Industry Packs, Website Builder handoff, Admin dashboards.
- Internal ops: CircuitBox UI (agent + repo + integration panel), job orchestration, governance + audit, deployment logs.
- Partner: EmbedPartner Kit, partner scans, co-branded / white-label pods (“PMO Office”).

## Deployable stack (Hostinger-first)
- Docker Compose “Longshoremen”: Agent Zero (execution), OpenClaw (autonomy), optional workflow automation, custom API gateway, DB services.
- Optional managed services: Firebase Auth/Firestore/Storage for authentication + tenant isolation + storage; these can coexist with Hostinger compute.

## Plug taxonomy (how to organize 100+ ideas)
- Calculators: deterministic math + PDF/estimate output + CTA funnel into website builder.
- Document intelligence: upload PDF/DOCX → extract → populate templates → export (DOCX/PDF).
- Growth engines: crawlers + auto-invite + market intelligence → partner dashboards.
- Assistant pods: deploy Boomer_Ang persona with governed tools; chat + actions + audit trails.
- Industry packs: the same core system with pack-specific discovery targets, templates, and Plug bundles.

## Measurement (what to track per launch)
- Deploy time (p50/p95).
- Activation: % who run first Plug within 10 minutes.
- Retention: 7d/30d.
- Revenue per workspace.
- Cost per run (tokens, minutes of compute).
- Support load: chats per active workspace.

## Files generated
- `AIMS_Plug_Launch_Tracker_Thorough.csv`: launch tracker with 105 Plug ideas + tracking columns.
- `AIMS_100_Plug_Ideas.csv`: raw idea list (105 rows).
